## What are the potential factors that affect the COVID-19 death rate?


### The original data is from Kaggle.com. All of these datasets are authorized to be used. There are four separate datasets related to the following topic: global covid report, global latitude and longitude data, global vaccination, global economy and global population.

### The aim of this project is to explore the potential factors that may affect COVID-19 death, and we put forward four factors that may have an impact on COVID-19 which is climate, vaccination, GDP and the population. 

### The stakeholder of this project is the person who is interested in the factors that may affect COVID-19 death. To explore this topic, there are five datasets that we are focusing on that can make contributions to this question. The first dataset is the COVID-19 death population in a variety of counties, the second dataset is the latitude of different areas which is more related to the climate, the third one is the global vaccination that contains different countries' vaccination, the fourth one is the global economy which has the different countries GDP which is a significant factor that we are going to analyze and the last one contains different countriesâ€™ population which is an important factor as well.
